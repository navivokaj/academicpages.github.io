Hi! I'm Jakov, and I dream to become a computational neuroscientist. This dream come from three motivations:

1. My passion for mathematics

Ever since I was a child, I already love numbers and symbols. This propelled me to take Applied Math (with a focus on mathematical finance) as my undergraduate and Masters course. Throughout the years, I have trained my brain to look at the universe through the lens of mathematics. I hope that I could do the same in our own 3-pound universe.

2. My interest in knowing how the brain works

I am fascinated with what the human brain does, how it performs various processes, and why the brain does what it does. Being born with a neurological disorder (spastic hemiplegia, a mild type of cerebral palsy affecting the right side of my body), I wonder how brain injuries occurring at prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal stages influence the anatomy and physiology of a developing brain. I hope that by studying neuroscience, I will know more of my lifetime condition and myself.

3. My desire to help humanity through scientific research

My life purpose is to contribute to the progress of humanity, and I believe that conducting scientific researches would be my way of doing so. My current research interests include neuroplasticity, models of neural computation, and reinforcement learning. I hope that by approaching the human brain through a mathematical/computational perspective, we can shed light to how humans can maximize their brainsâ€™ potential, and how to prevent, if not cure, neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases (such as cerebral palsy).

I believe that the field of computational neuroscience is the delicate intersection of these three reasons. And that is why I created this academic blog. As I am new to this field, I want to document my learning process and the fascinating ideas I come across. Someday, I hope that I will get into a good PhD program and work in an amazing lab. For the meantime, I will feed my brain with the knowledge needed to succeed in this field, keeping curiosity alive along the way
